*) It is an interactive program where the program first asks to play a new game or exit.

*) If the player choose to play he/she is presented with 3 modes -- 1) Player v/s Player 2) Player v/s AI 3) AI v/s AI.

*) Irrespective of the mode chosen the program asks for the number of sticks N to start the game with.

*) Then the program expects an integer K - The maximum number of sticks one can remove in 1 move (THE PROGRAM IS GENERALISED and hence allows user to choose the maximum limit to be other than 3 too!!)

*) Depending on the game mode chosen the user is prompted to make a move and is informed of the number of sticks left

*) After all the sticks have been removed program displays the winner and goes back to asking for new game or exit.

Note : Due to the interactive nature of the program input&output is shown in the "output.txt" file with a little extra formatting for clarity!
